            <b>Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on 15 October, 1931 at Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu</b>.He was the son of a humble fisherman who owned a boat. In order to supplement his father’s income, he used to distribute newspapers after attending school. In school, he was an average student, but hardworking and with a keen desire to learn. He was also fond of playing veena. Despite being a great and honoured man, his simplicity is personified, extremely down to Earth, kind and gentle. His love for children is revealed in the fact that even after holding the highest constitutional title he has been touring the entire nation, meeting school students, talking to them, lecturing them, interacting with them and inspiring them. All he wants to do is to open a small school in Rameshwaram and teach the children there, once he retires.All Indians are proud of his great achievements and humble persona. He observeed strict discipline, practices vegetarianism, teetotalism and celibacy. He read both the Quran and the Bhagwad Gita and his book ‘Guiding Souls’: Dialogues on the purpose of life’ reveals his spiritual facets too. Due to his open, approachable nature, he was referred to as ‘People’s President’. He showed that money can’t be a barrier to dreams, as he himself was from a poor family. He will continue to be a source of inspiration to one and all.

        <h3><u>Education</u></h3>
            In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics. After completing his education at the <b>Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram</b>, Kalam went on to attend <b>Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli</b>, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.
        <h3><u>Career</u></h3>

            He started his career with DRDO in 1958. Here, he designed a small helicopter for the Indian Army. He also became a part of the INCOSPAR Committee under Vikram Sarabhai. He went ahead to join ISRO five years later where he was the project director of SLV III. It was due to the team effort under his leadership that <b>‘Rohini’</b> was successfully launched in 1980. This was the beginning of India’s aerospace programme. Kalam initiated an independent work on an expandable rocket project in 1965. In 1969, he received government’s nod to incorporate more engineers in the project. In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the <strong>"Kalam-Raju Stent"</strong>. In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".</div>
